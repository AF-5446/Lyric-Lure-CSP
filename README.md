## Imagery
To best represent the website, and the ability music has to incorporate all walks of life, colour schemes were harder to choose, as music can represent every colour in the world. This then reflected in the imagery used, as trying to keep things neutral for new users/ visitors, but still entice return visits can prove difficult, which is why extensive searches through search engines like [Google](https://google.com/), and getting others opinions through websites like [Reddit](https://Reddit.com/) (an open interactive forum) were obtained to style the page.
